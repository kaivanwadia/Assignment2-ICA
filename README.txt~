hw1FindEigenDigits.m - The main function that calculates the Mean, Eigen Vectors and Eigen Values of the matrix. This is what is mentioned in the assignment.

hw1main.m - A Matlab script to run PCA and then form the classification model and test its accuracy using another helper function. The script also contains 
	a for loop to perform repeated tests in order to check accuracy by varying a single parameter. By changing the size of the varyingArray one can change
	the number of times the for loop is run. One can use the varyingArray to assign different values to a certain parameter for each iteration of the for
	loop.

CalculateAccuracy.m - A Matlab function which takes in the projected training images and a set of test images to label. The funciton labels
	the test images using a k-nn search algorithm and then checks whether the label is correct or incorrect to calculate the accuracy of the 
	classification model.

SelectTrainingSamples.m - A helper function which takes as input the trainingImages and outputs a subset of the training images that have been
	reshaped in the format required for PCA. The range of the subset is accepted as input to the function.

To run the code one needs to simply run the hw1main.m

The variables are pretty self explanatory and can be changed to get different results.
